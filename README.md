# Sudoku Solver
I wanted to solve sudoku's computationally :smile: . The main program `sudoku_solver.py` can be fed sudoku's either from other file types, or from stdin. Also if you download the full git repo, it comes with preinstalled puzzles and solutions that you can burn through to try and stump my program.

As always, feel free to email me or comment on the blog post if you have any questions or improvements. Have a great day!
